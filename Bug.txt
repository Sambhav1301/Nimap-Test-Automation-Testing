 write down bugs if found:


1.Responsive Design Issue: When I accessed the website on my mobile device, I noticed that the layout breaks and the navigation menu overlaps with the content, making it difficult to navigate. This is a major usability issue that needs to be fixed.

2.Missing Alt Text for Images: Upon inspecting the website's images, I found that some of them lack alt text, which is essential for accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO). This oversight can negatively impact the website's visibility and user experience.

3.Slow Page Load Time: I timed the website's page load time, and it took around 5-7 seconds to fully load. This can lead to a high bounce rate and negatively impact user experience. Optimizing images and compressing files could significantly improve page load time.

4.Not able to Sign-Up with mobile number - If user is given registered mobile number and correct then user unable to login.
